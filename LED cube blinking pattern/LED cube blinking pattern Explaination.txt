 * ............EXPLANATION OF THE CODE........

   The led cube is of dimension 4*4*4. where connection setup is as follows
    columns-
 [(x,y)-Pin] from left to right-
        (1,1)-13 (1,2)-12 (1,3)-11 (1,4)-10
        (2,1)-9  (2,2)-8  (2,3)-7  (2,4)-6
        (3,1)-5  (3-2)-4  (3-3)-3  (3,4)-2
        (4,1)-1  (4,2)-0  (4,3)-A5 (4,4)-A4

 Layers - [layer-Pin] from bottom to top are in order as follows
        a-A0  b-A1 c-A2 d-A3


initially i have gone through initialising, and declaring led rows along with pin numbers (starting from 13 ........1,0,a5,a4), led columns  (pin no -A3,A2,A1,A0).
Then declared rows, layers as output along with pin modes in the setup part.
now coming to the function loop , here i have mentioned all the functions to be used in the program along with respective delay that is provided to the function in void loop section.

function-turneverythingoff in this function loop all led from each of the layer is programmed to be off. here first we turn on all leds then turn off all leds together.

after that the function- turnEverythingOn() will make each led of the cube glow. here first we turn off all leds then turn on all leds together.

then the function loop turncolumnsoff() will ensure all led to be turned off simultaneously.
as these function will execute along with the delay time assingned to them will seem as leds are blinking .

now coming to the function loop turnOnAndOffAllByLayerUpAndDownNotTimed()- it ensures the turn on and turn off of all leds in a pattern that is called row flickering.this function gets executed according to the delay provided with in the function loop itself not in the void loop.where all led of a horizontal layer will glow simultaneously, then next layer reapeat the same and leds of previous layer will turn off,then next layer will repeat the same.then to repeat again from the first.
then all layer will glow one by one . after completion the turning off of layers will start from first till the last layer .
here i have taken delay is to be 75.


now coming to the function loop turnOnAndOffAllByColumnSideways() it ensures the turn on and turn off of all leds in a pattern that is called column flickering. this function gets executed according to the delay provided with in the function loop itself not in the void loop.where all led of a vertical layer will glow simultaneously, then next layer reapeat the same and leds of previous layer will turn off,then next layer will repeat the same.then to repeat again from the first.
then all layer will glow one by one . after completion the turning off of layers will start from first till the last layer .
here i have taken delay is to be 75.

After this in the next function loop propeller()- first we turn off all the leds. then initiate blinking by giving delay to the respective leds.then we put this in loop so that it will repeat for the given time interval as provided as delay in the function loop itself.
